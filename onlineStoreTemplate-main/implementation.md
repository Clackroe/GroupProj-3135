# Project 3: Implementation

## Introduction

The exciting part of the project has finally come. It is now time to implement the features you planned in the previous phase. In all likelihood, this will require a massive amount of work. That's why it is important to begin by planning the smaller changes you can make, divide these among your group, and work together to implement them. This process is repetitive, taking on larger and larger tasks as you go. The tasks listed below are not necessarily meant to be performed in sequence. They are, instead, a list of what we will be looking for when evaluating your implementation. Beyond just functionality, your project's code should be readable and well documented.

## Task 1: Code Style Guides

- Python files should be written in `lower_snake_case.py` format.
- Global variables and constants should be written in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
- Class names should be written in `UpperCamelCase`.
- Method and local variable names should be written in `lower_snake_case`.

## Task 2: Documentation Guides

- All classes, methods, and functions should be documented using the docstring format shown throughout the template codebase.
- After implementing a feature, be sure to update the relevant `plantuml` and `png` files in all respective subdirectories.
- Commit messages should be written to be descriptive of the changes made and the feature implemented. When writing code for a specific requirement from the `SRS.md`, you should use the requirement's ID in your commit message.

## Submission Details

- On Canvas, submit the following:
